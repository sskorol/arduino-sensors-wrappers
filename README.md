# Arduino Sensors' Wrappers Library

This library simplifies working with common devices like button, LED, motion sensor, RF receiver / transmitter, etc.

## Installation

Just follow the recommended [PlatformIO instructions](https://platformio.org/lib/show/6374/arduino-sensors-wrappers/installation).

In case of any manual updates, you have to clone this repository, make modifications and copy corresponding sources into ./lib/arduino-sensors-wrappers (assuming you're using PlatformIO) or Arduino/libraries/arduino-sensors-wrappers (in case of Arduino usage) folder.

## Usage

Check [examples](https://github.com/sskorol/arduino-sensors-wrappers/tree/master/examples) for details.
