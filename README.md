# Arduino Sensors' Wrappers Library

This library simplifies working with common devices like button, LED, motion sensor, RF receiver / transmitter, etc.

## Installation

As **arduino-sensors-wrappers** is not yet published to official registry, you have to download it manually. Just copy corresponding sources into **./lib/arduino-sensors-wrappers** (assuming you're using PlatformIO) or **Arduino/libraries/arduino-sensors-wrappers** (in case of Arduino usage) folder.

## Usage

Check [examples](https://github.com/sskorol/arduino-sensors-wrappers/tree/master/examples) for details.
